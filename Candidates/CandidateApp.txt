Candidate APP:
  1. Candidate APP is a basic app which list the candidate profile.
  2. On clicking the candidate id will redirect to the dedicated candidate profile page.
  3. In the profile page, user can either shortlist or reject the candidate.
  4. Here shortlisted and rejected link will redirect to the page containing the corresponding candidates list.
  5. I have used React Context to manage the state effeciently.

  
Technologies used:

Front-end:  React JS, context API for state Management
Deployment: Netlify
